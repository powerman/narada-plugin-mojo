Narada plugin: mojo
===================

This project was created using https://github.com/powerman/narada-plugin-mojo
(plugin for template for new projects designed for Narada framework).

This document describe how to use files provided by this plugin.


== Dependencies

Require https://github.com/powerman/narada-plugin-runit[Narada plugin
runit].

Require https://github.com/powerman/narada-plugin-socklog[Narada plugin
socklog].


== Usage

Edit `migrate` to set default value for config file `title` before first
release.

It also may be very convenient to automate restart of hypnotoad service on each
release. For example, if you're using narada-base's `./release` script then you
can modify it this way:

    release_version() {
            list_versions "$2" | grep -q -x -F "$1" && return 0
   +        echo -ne "\nrestart hypnotoad\n" >> "$2"
            echo -ne "\nINSTALL $1\nVERSION $1\n\n" >> "$2"
    }


== Setup

After new deploy you'll need to configure at least these:

- `config/hypnotoad/listen`
- `config/cookie.secret`
- `config/mode` (set to "production" on production server)

If this project will be attached to some path on website instead of full
website, you'll need to setup this path too. For example, if this project will
be attached to http://site/app/, then:

- `echo /app > config/basepath`
- If you run project as Apache CGI then modify `public/.htaccess` to:
+
----
RewriteBase /app/
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /app/web_site.cgi/$1 [L]
----
